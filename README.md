## My process

- First, I started by trying to figure out the structure of the design both on desktop and mobile.
- Then I did some brainstorming on the how I could code the design. (Using the basic knowledge I have in HTML & CSS until this moment.)
- I started coding the HTML structure first, then I got into the real hard task of the project: The CSS.
- I chose using CSS flexbox, as I never tried manipulating it before. It was a tiring first attempt because
  I don't know a lot of features. But I learned a lot while coding.
- Last, I used CSS media queries to code the CSS for mobile phone design.


### Built with

- Flexbox
- Css media query

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

This was my first time manipulating flexbox on my own. So it was a little bit challenging but I tried
to use my knowledge to get close to the design. Now, I can say that I upgraded my skills in flexbox a little bit.

### Continued development

Since I am new to FrontEnd developping, I want to improve my skills in CSS grid, Sass and learn Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

Google : I googled the solutions of the problems I had and I got a lot of helping answers mostly from StackOverFlow.
